# libvsync

libvsync is a C header-only library that contains most essential building blocks for concurrent applications.
That includes atomic operations, synchronization primitives and concurrent data structures.

All synchronization primitives have been verified and optimized with respect to weak memory models (WMM).
They also served as benchmarks for our ASPLOS'21 publication:
[VSync: Push-Button Verification and Optimization for Synchronization Primitives on Weak Memory Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3445814.3446748).

All data structures have been verified with respect to WMM.

The currently open sourced implementations
are algorithms from the literature implemented on top of our atomics, verified with model checkers,
and optimized using vsyncer.

We plan to gradually release more and more algorithms, including some of our own highly optimized algorithms.
